## Overview
*Perennial* is a top-down, 2D, turn-based, farming, strategy game made in Unity 6. The player advances through a loop of seasons — 
Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter — while growing crops on a 5x5 grid of soil tiles. The player’s goal is to generate Food by 
planting, tending, and harvesting fantasy crops. The game ends when the player either reaches a set Food quota (win), or 
has no way to plant new crops (loss).

*Perennial* was a prototype made during the GMTK 2025 Game Jam that I did with some members that would end up on my 
Graduate Capstone team as we wanted to test our process and roles. I was put in charge of programming the Plant system: 
programmatically designing plants that would have to be extensible, flexible, and, most importantly, highly-iterable. 
However, my contributions also extended outward as I helped reign in the final plant design for the Game Jam and 
what each plant should do in order to create a better gameplay experience.

## Design
### Finding the Fun in Plants
When we were originally designing the plants, we knew that each plant should have six traits: a Food Equation, to calculate
how much food it would give on harvest (scaling by months); a Growth Time (how long until the plant is harvestable); a 
Harvest Time (the number of months in which the plant can be harvested before dying); an Ability (which can be triggered in many ways);
Ungrowable Seasons (to force players to think with precaution); and Bonus Harvest Seasons (to incentivize players to think
strategically for rewards). However, early on, our designs were very basic and rushed out. In a game where our main strategy
came from placement, a lot of the plants punished the player for doing so (with the Chili killing adjacent plants when harvested for a lot
more food; or the Evil Carrot which would turn all Soil adjacent to it to be Weeded, or unplantable). It worked against our Mutation System,
which was to reward adjacency by rewarding players with new plants and allowing them to discover the different "recipes" that came with
harvesting plants that were adjacent to each other for different types of seeds. Overall, the players were not incentivized to use plants 
to adapt to seasons, soil, or mutational constraints (our strongest systems), but rather to other plants, which was already difficult
given our small 5x5 grid size.

When I was implementing the plants programmatically, I found that, when I was testing, I was having trouble actually *winning*. I did
an hour deep-dive as to why I wasn't having fun in a game that I was creating and proposed changes: to modify soil, seasonal resistance, or
mutation chances through the Abilities. As a rule, our Abilities should not directly attack plants, but rather offer buffs or debuffs to the 
environment. It should encourage combination over segregation, to help our players interact with the Mutation System. Then, for riskier plants,
we make it a double-edged sword: offer high risk for high reward.

The game instantly became a lot easier and a lot more fun during internal playtests (as well as small external playtests with friends).
For reference, our Chili Pepper now became: "When planted, increases food output of nearby plants, but Weeds nearby soil in half the time." It
was not just a general "food-for-debuff" ability like it was before, but it now fixated on aiding the plants around it, encouraging players to
engage with the risk by engaging with the ability and, consequently, the Mutation System. Due to how I programmed the Plant system, it was not
difficult to switch to these new Abilities either. If the project were to continue long term, we would be able to iterate on these Abilities
with ease as a designer, not having to worry about how much technical debt any changes would require.


## Programming
### Designing Systems to be Designer Friendly
With very little time to make the game for our game jam (I, personally, had about two days), the system that I had to make for the Plants had
to be 1) easy to understand and interface with, 2) extensible for any additional plants we might've added, and 3) designer-friendly. As a pure
programmer most of my life, that last part was difficult for me. I didn't have a lot of experience creating with a designer in mind. However, the
solution that I came up with was one of my proudest to date. 

I relied on my software engineering interests in patterns to make a fully component-based
system with Scriptable Object behaviors. Instead of traditional interfaces, the plants communicated through signals, allowing data-driven design without
coding necessary, the only thing the designer needed to do was to implement Behaviors through Scriptable Objects (which would be turned into a PlantBehaviorInstance
at runtime to hold state). The benefits were immense: designers could easily mix and match Plant Behaviors (which were also re-usable) in the Unity Inspector, as 
well as add their own new behaviors without touching existing code; each behavior would create an instance to allow it to track its own state during runtime;
type-safe queries still existed through the architecture, and it was SOLID compliant, extending the Open/Closed principle.

As a result, the designers on my team only needed a short onboarding to the tool before they could mix and match Abilities. This became especially useful
once we had to pivot to change our Plant Abilities to their second iteration to help find the fun (see above). If the game were to have continued,
the architecture put in place for the Plant System would have allowed for many new plants to have been added, all without having to touch any code
besides adding new, specified Behaviors to be re-used (which was commonly only a couple of lines).

### Practicing DevOps
As I noted before, my team and I would end up being together on our Graduate Capstone project. This was intentional: to try out our current process
together before jumping into a year-long one. Overall, we knew how we worked, but we wanted to nail down any questions about each others' processes,
and our process as a team, that we could answer/solve quickly when the semester started. However, I already knew one problem that we struggled with due 
to our experience with the Global Game Jam, only a semester-or-so before: building and deploying on time.

With my background in game production as a Production Intern at MAGIC Spell Studios, I was interested specifically in technical production and, more specifically, 
DevOps methodology. I decided to use this time to implement some basic Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment to help remedy our previous struggle. The
GitHub Action would check whenever a commit was pushed to the main branch and then automatically attempt to create a Unity web build that we could use for our 
itch.io page for submission. 

After a few tweaks, we were able to deploy many builds through pushing code, not having to worry about spending the last hour to worry about how long it will 
take to deploy or final product. Overall, we still had other issues in terms of technical production: mainly the lack of a branching model, which led to a lot 
of merges that we had to fix in a panic, as well as some hidden uses of the OnValidate() function that would eventually sneak past our eyes and prevent us 
from having a working WebGL build by the deadline. However, the issue that was prominent during our time at the Global Game Jam, was no longer an issue now, and 
would likely not become an issue in the future. As we wrapped up the project, I continued to think how I could continue to study DevOps and further simplify 
the process for programmers in game development, and it is what I ended up wanting to research alongside my capstone project.
