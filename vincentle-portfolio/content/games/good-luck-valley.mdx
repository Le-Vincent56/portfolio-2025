## Overview
*Good Luck Valley* is a 2D, narratively-driven, adventure-platformer set in a magical Spirit World known
as the Valley. Follow Anari on her journey through the Valley, a beautiful sprawling forest, where every secret
she uncovers draws her deeper into the world's mysterious magic. As Anari, players will use athletic movement and 
a magical mushroom mechanic to explore the world. Each action of her journey will leave a constructive result on the 
slowly-corrupting forest around her. Meet spirits, each with their own magical characteristics and unique personalities;
some will hinder your journey, others will guide it. But along the way, Anari might just find out how to unite them all,
and restore the balance of the Valley.

*Good Luck Valley* diversifies the adventure-platformer experience. With modern, genre-defining games, such as *Hollow Knight*,
*Ori and the Blind Forest*, and *Gris*, there is typically a trade-off within their gameplay. Exploring *Hollow Knight*'s enchanting
and expansive world requires a higher level of skill revolving around their combat system; the engaging and varied gameplay
of *Ori and the Blind Forest* lacks world-incorporated feedback; the cinematic and emotional experience of *Gris* requires a slower
and more thoughtful game loop. *Good Luck Valley* amends the sacrifices of these games to provide an evocative and accessible
experience. *Good Luck Valley* retains the magical world of *Hollow Knight* through a lower skill ceiling. *Good Luck Valley* 
emulates the versatile gameplay of *Ori and the Blind Forest* while providing immersive, world-affecting feedback.
And, *Good Luck Valley* derives the cinematics of *Gris* within an involving and athletic atmosphere.

## Design
### Establishing Design pillars
Early in development, our gameplay didn't match the experience we actually wanted to deliver.
We kept drifting toward *Hollow Knight*-like worlds and wanted *Ori and the Blind Forest*-style
mechanics; games we admired, but also ones aimed at more experienced players. Our intended audience,
inspired by Studio Ghibli fans, needed something more accessible: a game with beautiful storytelling
and approachable gameplay. Instead, we were building something too difficult and unfocused. The problem
wasn't just the mechanics themselves, but that the team didn't share a unified philosophy for what the
game should *feel* like.

I pitched the idea of creating design pillars as a way to ground us. We scheduled one full meeting to hash
it out, but like all good meetings, it turned into two. Each team member described how they envisioned the
game and the results showed that we had similar, but not identical, goals, which made it clear why development
felt scattered. Together, we sorted through a long list of values, finding words like *Versatile*, *Discovery*,
*Growth*, and *Cohesive*, but realized these were "nice-to-haves" rather than essential traits. What we needed
were uncompromising guideposts. We ended up with three: **Energetic**, **Magical** and **Simplistic**. They
captured both our emotional goals and our design needs, while cutting away the noise.

These pillars became a turning point. They gave us the confidence to lean into mechanics like the Fireflies (Magical + Simplistic)
and the Shroomflies (Energetic + Magical + Simplistic), both of which playtesters grasped instantly at events like GDC
and 1Upstate. At the same time, they gave us clarity to cut features that didn't fit, like shelving Ogo until
he could be made more approachable. For me, this was a design leadership moment: putting an emergency stop on the project
that was veering off-course and guiding the team through the kind of pre-production process we had skipped as
freshmen. With the pillars in place, we weren't just brute-forcing ideas anymore, we had a shared philosophy that
made decision clearer and more confident.

### Switching the Main Mechanic
When we first built *Good Luck Valley*, the Mushroom Throw was positioned as our main mechanic.
On paper, it seemed like the right choice: a magical mushroom that you could summon and use
to bounce in a flexible way; it felt central to the fantasy. But during playtests, it consistently
confused players and provided a challenge for them in a game that was supposed to be easy and accessible.
Puzzles built around it were too difficult early on, and the mechanic didn't click the way we imagined.
Meanwhile, nearly every playtester went out of their way to highlight how fun the Quick Bounce secondary mechanic
was. Even on feedback forms, they'd spend their final notes just to call out how satisfying it felt. 
It was clear we had misidentified our core hook.

I pitched swapping their roles. Instead of forcing players through a confusing primary mechanic from the
start, we'd elevate the bounce to the center of our design and delay, or even cut, the Mushroom Throw.
The team immediately agreed once I referenced the pile of playtest results backing the idea. From a coding 
standpoint, the change was minor: the bounce was already implemented, it just needed to be refactored to work 
cleanly with the new player controller. The biggest shift was philosophical. We re-centered development around three 
design pillars: Energetic, Magical, and Simplistic. We used them as a lens for every decision moving forward. 
The Quick Bounce hit all three, while the Mushroom Throw simply didn't.

The impact was immediate. New playtesters picked up the bounce instantly, many didn't even realize it 
had once been a "new" mechanic. Traversal scores shot up, confusion disappeared, and the game simply felt fun
to play. Cutting the Mushroom Throw early also freed us to design new secondary mechanics that better reflected the 
world's Spirits, which ended up strengthening our level design as well. For me, it was mix a of instinct and evidence: 
I knew as a player, the game wasn't that fun, but I grounded that gut feeling in data and structure to convince 
the team and reorient the project.


## Programming / Technical Design
### Refactoring the Game
Like a lot of student prototypes, our early codebase was a mess. We had giant MonoBehaviours doing everything,
dependencies tangled across unrelated systems, and very little respect for SOLID or DRY principles. Modularity
and scalability were basically nonexistent, naming conventions were inconsistent, and comments were sparse. It
worked well enough to get a prototype on its feet, but every feature felt like duct tape on a sinking ship. Bugs
piled up, iteration slowed, and it became clear the codebase couldn't support the game we wanted to build.

The first major refactor came once we committed to taking *Good Luck Valley* seriously as a long-term project. I
started by tackling the biggest pain points: the player controller and mushroom mechanics, which were at the core
of our prototype. But when our team reoriented around new design pillars and swapped our main mechanic, it became
obvious that patching wasn't enough; the game needed to be rebuilt from the ground up. Taking on responsibility for
the entire codebase, I made early architectural decisions with both modularity and designer-friendliness in mind.
For example, our level designer Brody needed tools that wouldn't bog him down in technical details, so I implemented
data-driven systems using ScriptableObject and refactored our architecture to cleanly follow SOLID and DRY principles.game

The results were worth the time lost in the rebuild. Adding new mechanics became faster, iteration cycles sped up, and
systems like Wwise integration fit into the project much more smoothly. While it was a necessary engineering fix, it was also
an immense learning experience. I became a lot more confident in structuring scalable systems and I learned the value of 
planning architecture with designers in mind. Looking back, I wish I had layered in more DevOps practices: automated builds on push,
CI/CD pipelines tied to our Trello board, and a stronger culture of unit testing would have made iteration even smoother. But compared
to where we started, the refactors transformed our project from a fragile prototype into a codebase capable of sustaining development.

### Using Unity Jobs and Burst
One major challenge during the early builds of *Good Luck Valley* was its performance. For a 2D game, it was unreasonably
slow, which was not ideal for a game that requires responsiveness and aesthetic appeal. I spent a lot of time in the
Unity Profiler, finding that a lot of our game was running on the CPU rather than the GPU, especially since everything
was single-threaded on the Unity PlayerLoop.

To resolve this, I did some research into Unity DOTS and specifically the Job System. I found that the Job System was a great
way to parallelize work across multiple threads, but it was also a bit of a black box. I had to read through the documentation
and experiment with different integrations to finally wrap my head around how it worked. In parallel, I also had to use
Unity's Burst compiler to take advantage of the Job system. Consequently, I had to rewrite a lot of my code using
C# and C++ interop, mainly provided by the Unity API (such as NativeArray).

The results were dramatic. I ended up implementing the Job system for our parallax, which required many background assets to move
in sync with the player at different speeds to emulate depth; and for our fireflies, which had multiple fireflies moving at once,
both around the player and in their own spaces. Along with the rest of my refactors, I was able to gain approximately 87 FPS according
to the Unity Profiler, which allowed us to maintain performance on many of our team laptops that we could not before.

## Audio
### Making Audio Reactive, Not Decorative
In the early builds of *Good Luck Valley*, audio felt flat. Unity's built-in audio system worked well enough for placeholders, but
as both a programmer and composer, I found it limiting. Adding interactivity required too much extra work, and as a designer, I 
wanted more direct control over how music and sound responded to the game. I experimented briefly with FMOD, but ultimately moved to Wwise 
because its feature set (Switches, RTPCs, and built-in effects) gave me far more flexibility to design audio systems that could 
react to the world instead of just sit behind it.

I started by setting up a full Wwise project with clear naming conventions and layered bus structures for both music and SFX. From there, 
I integrated RTPCs for things like distance-based volume and effects (most notably in our Mushroom Pickup and Lotus Ending scenes), and 
used States for environmental shifts, horizontal sequencing, and transitions between game states. The leitmotifs I had written for the Vallley, 
the Forest, and Anari could now exist dynamically in context; for example, surfacing in the title screen, weaving into background layers during 
exploration, and punctuating key stingers like the Mushroom Pick. Over time, I refined the musical structure to two main loops rather than three, 
simplifying progression while keeping cohesion across levels. 

The results were dramatic. Playtest music scores jumped from the 5-6 range to an average of 9.1-9.7. Players may not have always known *why* it felt
better, but they consistently described the game as more immersive, as if the world was alive and responding to them. For me, this was design-first thinking
realized through technical execution: Wwise gave me the tools to let audio become a core part of the Spirit World's identity, reactive and intertwined 
with the game's systems instead of ornamental.

### Balancing Realism and Magic in Sound
One of the trickiest challenges in *Good Luck Valley* was finding the right balance between sounds that felt natural and sounds that felt otherworldly.
We wanted the game to be grounded in the forest and its physicality, but also heavily magical in tone. At first, I didn't have any clear rules for how 
"real" vs. "magical" each sound should be, I just created whatever came to mind. The result was inconsistent: some sounds were overly realistic, 
others were fantastical without context, and the Spirit World didn't feel cohesive. 

To fix this, I developed what I called the "realism test → twist test." If a sound was emitting from a source that I would deem as "realistic", the sound 
would have to pass as believable in the real world, and then I'd layer in something that gave it a fantastical edge. For something grounded, like Anari's clothes, 
this realism came first: foley of fabric movement. But then, I layered in the ruffling of scrapbook paper to give it a storybook twist. Her footsteps even needed 
some slight treatment. They were too real, sounding heavy and distracting. So, I EQ'd out low frequencies and made them lighter and more youthful to better match 
Anari's adventurous energy. Another example is our firefly mechanic, which originally had very literal sounds: plucking fruit from a tree and tiny teeth crunching
as the fireflies ate. It was funny, but it felt completely wrong for these creatures that originated from magic. I reworked the design around a subtle motif: a consistent, 
ethereal wind-chime and bell-like texture that plays across all firefly- and Spirit-related sounds.

The result was an aural style that reinforced immersion instead of breaking it. Players described the experience not in terms of individual sounds, 
but as "everything working well together." That was the goal: cohesion, not spectacle. The audio complemented the art, the art complemented the gampelay, 
and all of it supported the story. For me, this was more of an artistic exercise than a technical one, but it was one of the most rewarding parts of the project. 
It gave me the chance to shape the Spirit World's identity not just through music, but through the texture of its sound, blending realism and magic until they felt 
inseparable.
